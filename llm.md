In vim, how to enable dictionary completion?
To enable dictionary completion in Vim, you can use the following steps:

### 1. Create a dictionary file

Create a file with a list of words, one word per line, and save it with a `.dict` extension (e.g., `mydictionary.dict`).

### 2. Add the dictionary to Vim

Add the dictionary to Vim by running the command:

```
:set dictionary+=/path/to/mydictionary.dict
```

Replace `/path/to/mydictionary.dict` with the actual path to your dictionary file.

### 3. Enable dictionary completion

Enable dictionary completion by running the command:

```
:filetype plugin on
```

This will enable the plugin for the current file type.

### 4. Use dictionary completion

Now, when you're in insert mode, you can use dictionary completion by pressing `Ctrl-X` and then `Ctrl-K`. This will bring up a list of words from your dictionary that match the prefix you've typed.

You can also use `:help dictionary` to learn more about dictionary completion in Vim.

where the default dicts
The default dictionary files in Vim are usually in the following locations:

* `/usr/share/vim/vim{version}/spell/` (e.g., `/usr/share/vim/vim82/spell/`)
* `~/.vim/spell/` (in your home directory)


These directories contain language-specific dictionaries, such as `en.utf-8.add` for American English.

You can check the current dictionary settings by executing `:set dictionary?` or `:set dictionary?`
